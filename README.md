Daily a new News channel is coming in the market in some channel one news is shown whereas in other channels some other news is shown many a time same news sounds 
different on different news channel, recently many of the news channels have started with their online channels where facilities like e-newspapers is also provided.
No of people use this e-newspaper but again reading a lengthy news is a time consuming task and sometimes boring, many times a complete page have only two or three 
lines of information. A standardized solution is needed where on a single platform where user can get all news depending on his/ her choice and also in summarized manner. 
Also a strategy is needed which will provide the user correct news and not a fake news.
